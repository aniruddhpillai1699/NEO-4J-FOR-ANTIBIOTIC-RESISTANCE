# NEO-4J-FOR-ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE-AN-ALTERNATIVE-VIEW-OF-COMPREHENSIVE-ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE-DATABASE

Graph databases are a paradigm shift away from relational databases, with a significant emphasis on "relationships." Unlike relational databases, which compute associations at runtime, graph databases save relationships for fast querying and data retrieval. This paper describes antibiotic resistance- an alternative view of comprehensive antibiotics. Wetransformed the biological data from relational databases/files and provide new insights. Even though there are numerous graph databases available, Neo4j is without a doubt the industry leader. It's easy to use and scale. Its Cypher language is simple to grasp. Finally, the Graph Data Science Library offers a wide range of powerful graph manipulation and machine learning capabilities.
